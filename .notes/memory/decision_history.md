# Decision History

## Testing Framework Selection (2024-04-04)
- **Decision**: Adopted Vitest as primary testing framework
- **Rationale**: Better ESM support, faster execution, and better integration with React
- **Impact**: Improved test execution speed and developer experience
- **Alternatives Considered**: Jest, Mocha

## Test Pattern Standardization (2024-04-04)
- **Decision**: Standardized component test structure with proper mocking
- **Rationale**: Consistent testing approach across all components
- **Impact**: Reduced test flakiness and improved maintainability
- **Key Patterns**:
  - Complete form library mocking
  - Component isolation
  - Proper async testing

## Performance Testing Strategy (2024-04-04)
- **Decision**: Removed QueryOptimizationTest and plan for new approach
- **Rationale**: Current implementation caused architectural conflicts and test instability
- **Impact**: Temporarily reduced test coverage but improved overall test reliability
- **Next Steps**:
  - Design isolated performance test suite
  - Implement proper database setup
  - Create dedicated performance monitoring
  - Use separate test database for performance tests

## Current Test Issues (2024-04-04)
1. Frontend Issues
   - ResizeObserver not defined in test environment
   - Module import issues with ES modules
   - API mocking inconsistencies
   - Test data synchronization problems

2. Test Environment
   - Need proper performance test isolation
   - Database setup for performance testing
   - Test data generation strategy
   - Monitoring and metrics collection
