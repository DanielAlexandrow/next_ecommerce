# Test State Memory

## Recent Fixes
- Fixed ReviewComponent test failures by:
  1. Properly handling form submission state management
  2. Adding proper loading state handling
  3. Wrapping state updates in `act()` for React testing
  4. Implementing comprehensive form validation tests
  5. Adding test coverage for error cases and multiple submission prevention

## Current Test Status
- All tests are passing
- No React testing warnings
- Test coverage improved for ReviewComponent

## TODO List
1. Add more edge cases for product filters
2. Add concurrency tests for bulk operations
3. Improve test coverage for:
   - Error boundary testing
   - Form validation edge cases
   - Loading state transitions

## Test Suite Performance
- Slowest: ProductServiceTest (0.4s)
- Fastest: CategoryControllerTest (0.2s)

## Recent Lessons Learned
1. Always wrap React state updates in `act()` during testing
2. Use `userEvent.setup()` for better event handling in tests
3. Test loading states and disabled states during form submission
4. Prevent multiple form submissions while processing
5. Handle and test error cases comprehensively

## Edge Cases to Watch
1. Form submission during loading state
2. Multiple rapid form submissions
3. Error handling during network failures
4. State management during component unmount
5. Validation edge cases for special characters

## Last 10 Errors and Solutions
1. React testing warnings about `act()` - Fixed by wrapping state updates
2. Multiple form submissions - Fixed by adding submission state check
3. Missing error handling - Added comprehensive error tests
4. Incomplete form validation - Added validation checks
5. Loading state issues - Added proper loading state management
