# Test Issues and Solutions

## Current Status (2024-01-17)

### PHP Tests
- âœ… All 65 tests passing (181 assertions)
- Key test suites:
  - ProductControllerTest
  - ProductOrderTest
  - ProductCreationTest

### Vitest Tests
- ðŸ”„ In Progress
- Recent Issues:
  1. ImageSelect component undefined map error
     - Solution: Mocked ImageSelect component to prevent undefined variable issues
  2. act(...) warnings
     - Solution: Wrapped all state updates in act()
  3. Form submission test failures
     - Solution: Improved form context mocking with createMockFormContext
  4. Input changes and checkbox toggle failures
     - Solution: Fixed event handling in form context mock
  5. Unhandled error with form.setError
     - Solution: Added setError and clearErrors to form context mock

## Recent Fixes

### ProductForm.test.tsx
1. Added comprehensive mock for react-hook-form
2. Improved child component mocking (BrandSelect, CategorySelect, ImageSelect)
3. Enhanced form submission handling with proper event prevention
4. Added proper state management for input changes and checkbox toggles
5. Fixed form context mock to include all required methods (setError, clearErrors)
6. Improved event handling for input changes and checkbox toggle

## Known Edge Cases
1. Form submission with empty required fields
2. Special character handling in product names
3. Image selection with no available images
4. Brand/Category selection with empty lists

## Next Steps
1. Verify all act(...) warnings are resolved
2. Ensure ImageSelect mock properly handles empty states
3. Add test coverage for edge cases
4. Improve error handling tests

## Lessons Learned
1. Always include complete form context mock with all required methods
2. Wrap state updates in act() to prevent warnings
3. Mock child components to prevent undefined variable issues
4. Handle events properly in form context mock
5. Test both success and error cases for form submission
