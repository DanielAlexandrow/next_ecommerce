### Test Coverage Improvements
1. Form Testing
   - Added validation error scenarios
   - Added API error scenarios
   - Added form state management tests
   - Added character limit tests
   - Added special character handling tests

2. Component State Management
   - Added loading state tests
   - Added form submission state tests
   - Added pagination state tests
   - Added sort state persistence tests

3. API Integration
   - Added network error scenarios
   - Added pagination integration tests
   - Added sort integration tests

### Lessons Learned
1. Form Testing
   - Use `fireEvent.submit` on form elements instead of clicking submit buttons
   - Target form field elements through their Controller components
   - Always wrap state changes in `act()`
   - Use `waitFor` for async operations

2. Component State Management
   - Loading states should be applied to correct container elements
   - Check parent elements for applied classes when testing UI states
   - Mock API calls with proper timing for loading states

3. Test Configuration
   - Keep E2E tests in the directory specified by test configuration
   - Separate E2E tests from component tests
   - Follow framework-specific test setup requirements

### Next Steps
1. Add more edge case tests:
   - Form validation with special characters
   - Form validation with empty spaces
   - Form validation with HTML tags
   - Form validation with SQL injection attempts

2. Add performance tests:
   - Loading state transitions
   - Form submission timing
   - Pagination response time
   - Sort operation response time

3. Add accessibility tests:
   - Form error announcements
   - Loading state announcements
   - Sort button ARIA labels
   - Keyboard navigation

4. Add visual regression tests:
   - Form error states
   - Loading states
   - Sort direction indicators
   - Rating display
