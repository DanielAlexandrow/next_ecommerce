### Lessons Learned
1. Form Testing
   - Use `fireEvent.submit` on form elements instead of clicking submit buttons
   - Target form field elements through their Controller components
   - Always wrap state changes in `act()`
   - Use `waitFor` for async operations

2. Component State Management
   - Loading states should be applied to correct container elements
   - Check parent elements for applied classes when testing UI states
   - Mock API calls with proper timing for loading states

3. Test Configuration
   - Keep E2E tests in the directory specified by test configuration
   - Separate E2E tests from component tests
   - Follow framework-specific test setup requirements

### Previous Issues Resolution Status
All previous issues have been resolved. Key fixes:
1. Form event handling in ProductForm tests
2. Review component form submission and validation
3. Loading state management in ReviewComponent
4. E2E test configuration for Playwright

### Next Steps
1. Add more edge case tests for form validation
2. Improve API error handling test coverage
3. Add more E2E tests for critical user flows
4. Consider adding performance tests for loading states
