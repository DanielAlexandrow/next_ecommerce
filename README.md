## Development Notes & Lessons Learned

### UI/UX Improvements
1. **Modal vs. Inline Forms**
   - Initially used inline forms for create/edit operations
   - Switched to modals for better UX and consistency
   - Modals provide better focus and clearer context

2. **Table Design**
   - Standardized table design across all list views
   - Added consistent text centering
   - Improved action button placement
   - Added card wrappers for better visual hierarchy

3. **Component Structure**
   - Separated modals into standalone components
   - Improved reusability of form components
   - Consistent modal patterns for create/edit operations

### State Management
1. **Zustand Implementation**
   - Used Zustand for global state management
   - Separate stores for different features (products, brands, etc.)
   - Clear actions and state updates

2. **React Query**
   - Implemented for server state management
   - Improved caching and data fetching
   - Better loading and error states

### API Design
1. **Endpoint Structure**

   - Implemented pagination
   - Added sorting capabilities
   - Optimized re-renders

2. **Modal Management**
   - Lazy loading of modal content
   - Proper cleanup on modal close
   - State reset between operations

### Code Organization

   - Feature-based organization
   - Shared components in common directory
   - Clear separation of concerns

2. **Type Safety**
   - Comprehensive TypeScript interfaces
   - Proper type checking
   - Improved development experience

### Future Improvements
