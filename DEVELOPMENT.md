# Development Documentation

## API Testing Strategy

### Current Approach
- Basic error handling tests implemented
- Focus on HTTP status codes
- Simple request validation
- OpenAPI/Swagger documentation integration started

### Contract Testing Progress
- Installed L5-Swagger package
- Set up basic OpenAPI configuration
- Defined security scheme for Bearer authentication
- Ready for endpoint-specific documentation

### Next Steps for Contract Testing
1. Document all API endpoints with OpenAPI annotations
2. Generate and verify API documentation
3. Set up automated contract testing
4. Implement response validation

### Alternative Approaches

1. **Integration Testing Focus**
   - Test complete user flows
   - Mock external services
   - Focus on business logic validation

2. **Load Testing**
   - Implement performance tests
   - Use tools like K6 or Apache JMeter
   - Focus on concurrent users and response times

## Lessons Learned
- Start with basic error scenarios
- HTTP status codes are fundamental
- Input validation is critical
- Consider security implications early
- API documentation is crucial for team collaboration

## Next Steps
1. Document existing API endpoints
2. Set up automated documentation generation
3. Implement contract testing with PHPUnit
4. Consider adding performance benchmarks
